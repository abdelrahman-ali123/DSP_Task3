# Voice Password Application

## Brief Description
A Web Application for **voice recognition** using ML. The application identifies the speaker and if the password is correct or not.


## Implementation
We used **MFCC** Technique for extracting features from the voice, and **GMM** Model for voice recognition based on the speaker's score.
